          <h2>1. ABOUT THE JOURNAL</h2>
          <p>The Journal of Global Operations (JGO) is a leading peer-reviewed publication dedicated to advancing knowledge in operations management, supply chain management, and related fields. We publish high-quality research that contributes to theory and practice.</p>

          <h2>2. MANUSCRIPT CATEGORIES</h2>

          <h3>2.1 Original Article</h3>
          <p>Original articles present new findings and contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field. These articles should be structured properly with clear sections.</p>

          <h4>2.1.1 Reporting Checklist</h4>
          <p>Authors must ensure that all items in the appropriate reporting checklist have been included in the manuscript or explained if unavailable.</p>

          <h4>2.1.2 Selection and Description of Participants</h4>
          <p>In study articles, the process of selection for observational or experimental subjects (healthy individuals or patients, including controls) should be clearly set out in the methods section. Any eligibility or exclusion criteria should be provided, along with a description of the population from which the subjects were sourced. Ideally, representative populations should be included in all study types, and characteristics (such as age, sex, or ethnicity) of the study population should be described. Terms relating to sex (when reporting biological factors) and gender (identity, psychosocial or cultural factors) should be used correctly, and the sex and/or gender of the human participants, or the sex of animals or cells, should be reported, except where this is not appropriate. The methods used to classify sex and gender should also be described, where relevant. If the study focused on a specific population, for example in only one sex, the authors should explain their reasoning for this. For race and ethnicity, authors should describe how these were determined, and their relevance to the study should be explained. Study subjects should be described in the most neutral, exact, and respectful language possible. Any language that might cause the stigmatization of subjects must be avoided.</p>

          <p>Authors are encouraged to refer to the SAGER guidelines for reporting of sex and gender information in study design, data analyses, results, and interpretation of findings: <a href="http://www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sager-guidelines/">www.equator-network.org/reporting-guidelines/sager-guidelines/</a> (12).</p>

          <h4>2.1.3 Research Resource Identifiers (RRID)</h4>
          <p>JGO is pleased to be a part of the <strong>Research Resource Identification Initiative</strong> (13), a project aimed at clearly identifying key research resources used in the course of scientific experiments. These include antibodies, cell lines, model organisms, and software tools. To help authors quickly find the correct identifiers for their materials there is a single website (<a href="https://scicrunch.org/resources">https://scicrunch.org/resources</a>) (13) where all resource types can be found and a 'cite this' button next to each resource that contains proper citation text that should be included in the methods section of the manuscript. Several examples of properly formatted methods sections with RRIDs can be found below:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Antibodies:</strong> "antibody against ERK1 (Abgent Cat# AP7251E, RRID: AB_2140114)."</li>
            <li><strong>Cell Lines:</strong> "we used the following cell lines: RRID: CVCL_1H60..."</li>
            <li><strong>Genetically modified organisms:</strong> "Fgf9Eks-Fgf9+ mice (RRID: MGI_3840442)..."</li>
            <li><strong>Software tools:</strong> "...terminals were mapped (Neurolucida, v10, RRID: SCR_001775)."</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2.2 Review Article</h3>
          <p>Review articles are articles that identify, synthesize and summarize existing evidence and information on a specific topic. Review articles should present a timely, comprehensive analysis of a specific topic. We welcome the submission of proposals for review articles for initial consideration.</p>

          <p><strong>Word limit:</strong> 6,000 words max, including abstract but excluding references, tables, and figures.</p>
          <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> 200–350 words. Unstructured, except for certain types of reviews, e.g., systematic reviews without meta-analysis, scoping reviews, and narrative reviews.</p>
          <p><strong>Keywords:</strong> 3–5.</p>

          <h4>2.2.1 Systematic Reviews without Meta-analysis</h4>
          <p>Systematic reviews should adhere to PRISMA guidelines and include a PRISMA flow diagram. Authors should provide a detailed description of the methodology used, including search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, quality assessment, and data extraction process.</p>

          <h4>2.2.2 Scoping Review</h4>
          <p>Scoping reviews map the existing literature on a topic without detailed quality assessment. These reviews are useful to identify research gaps and summarize findings when the literature is diverse.</p>

          <h4>2.2.3 Narrative Review (Also Called Literature Review)</h4>
          <p>Narrative reviews provide an overview of a topic based on selected literature. While less structured than systematic reviews, narrative reviews should still have clear objectives and methodology sections.</p>

          <h2>3. MANUSCRIPT SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h2>
          <p>All manuscripts should be submitted through our online submission system. Before submission, ensure your manuscript meets all formatting requirements and is free of errors.</p>

          <h2>4. STATISTICAL REQUIREMENTS</h2>
          <p>Statistical methods should be described with enough detail to enable a knowledgeable reader with access to the original data to verify the reported results. When possible, findings should be quantified and presented with appropriate indicators of measurement error or uncertainty.</p>

          <h2>5. STYLE OF THE MANUSCRIPT</h2>
          <p>Manuscripts should be written in clear, concise English. American or British English spelling may be used, but should be consistent throughout the manuscript. The journal encourages the use of straightforward language that communicates scientific content effectively.</p>

          <h2>6. COPYRIGHT AND PERMISSIONS</h2>
          <p>Authors retain copyright of their work but grant the journal exclusive license to publish. For material reproduced from other sources, authors must obtain permission from the copyright holder and submit it with the manuscript.</p>
